# Calculator Program

This project implements a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations using Python. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and allows users to perform multiple calculations in one session.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides one number by another.

## Python Concepts Covered üêç

- Functions
- Dictionaries
- Loops (For Loops, While Loops)
- Recursion

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Function Definitions**: Functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are defined.
2. **Dictionary of Operations**: A dictionary maps operators to their respective functions.
3. **Main Calculator Function**: 
   - Prompts the user for input numbers and an operator.
   - Performs the selected operation.
   - Offers options to continue with the result, start a new calculation, or exit the program.

## Example Usage üìã

```python
Input a number: 5
+ 
- 
* 
/ 
Select an operator: +
Input the second number: 3
5 + 3 = 8
Type 'y' to continue calculating with 8, 'n' to start a new calculation, or 'e' to escape the application: n
```

## Installation & Setup üöÄ

To run the calculator program, you'll need Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to get started:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/brianhernandez04/pythoncalculator
    ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd calculator
    ```

3. **Run the program:**
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
